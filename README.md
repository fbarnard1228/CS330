1. How do I approach designing software?
   When coding I tend to follow whatever requirements are set forth. Knowing the issue
   you are attempting to tackle is the first step in software design. This entails compiling
   and examining the project's needs, objectives, limitations, and presumptions. It is
   imperative to ascertain the consumers' needs, preferences, and areas of discomfort.
   
2. How do I approach developing programs?
   I tried to reuse code that worked in the past. As I have in my job. I will look for a piece of code that works and reuse that code and
   shape it in the way that I need it used. I had to use iteration on each change for my code. I had to rerun the code when repoisitioning
   my shapes. I would say that it was overwheming at first and got easier as the milestones progressed. The code became more familiar,
   therefore easier to unserstand.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   Computer Science  and this class has taught me a great many things. That effect my current knowledge in my current role,
   and demonstrate what I could do for future employers. These skills will be pivotal in showing how my skills can translte to the
   workforce.
